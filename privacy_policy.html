    <h2> Privacy Policy </h2>
    <b> Revised December 2022 </b><br><br>
    
<h2>This site is part of the Blogging websites.</h2><br>
  <p>  The Blogging Website takes your privacy very seriously. Because of this we want to provide you with explicit information on how we collect, gather, and identify information during your visit to our site. This information may be expanded or updated as we change or develop our site. For this reason, we recommend that you review this policy from time-to-time to see if anything has changed. Your continued use of our site signifies your acceptance of our privacy policy.</p>
    
<p>   "Personally Identifiable Information" refers to information that tells us specifically who you are, such as your name, phone number, email or postal address. In many cases we need this information to provide the personalized or enhanced service that you have requested.</p>
    
<p>   The amount of "Personally Identifiable Information" that you choose to disclose to the Blogging Website is completely up to you. The only way we know something about you personally is if you provide it to us in conjunction with one of our services.</p>
    
<br><h2> What information do we collect and how do we use it?</h2><br>
<p>   The Blogging Website collects information on our users in three ways: by your voluntary submissions (for instance, if you sign up for one of our email newsletters) and/or surveys; sweepstakes and/or contest entries; and through cookie technology.</p>
    
<p>   In our effort to provide personalization and opportunities for prizes and services, we may at times ask you to submit information such as your name or email address, or to share your interests with us. You never have to answer these questions, and you can decline this exchange of information on any site on the Internet—not just ours—at any time. However, if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with some of the services dependent upon the collection of this information, such as a personalized email, contest entries, or the purchase and shipment of products to people who visit our network.</p>
    
<p>   The information that the Blogging Website collects is used in a variety of ways: for internal review; to improve the content of the site, thus making your user experience more valuable; to notify you about updates to the service; and to let you know about products and services that you may be interested in.</p>
    
<p>   If you have provided us your email address, The Blogging Website periodically sends promotional emails to its subscribers about services offered. If you do not wish to receive information via email from the Blogging Website, please let us know by sending us a mail.</p>
    
<p>   The "email this article" feature is an easy way for you to send articles through email. The email addresses that you supply to use this service will not be used for any other purpose without your consent.</p>
    
<br><h2> With whom do we share the information?</h2><br>
<p>   We do not share email addresses with outside organizations. However, from time-to-time, you might receive information from various Blogging websites. As a valued visitor to our site, we offer you the opportunity to "opt out," or request not to accept these emails. If, at any time, you change your mind and do not want the Blogging Website to share your email address or home address with other Blogging Website and/or organizations, or would simply like to be removed from the list, please let us know by sending us a mail.</p>
    
<br><h2>Contests</h2><br>
<p>   From time-to-time the Blogging Website, along with our other Blogging Websites, provide contests for the enjoyment of our users. By participating in the contest or sweepstakes and answering any and all questions, the user understands that the Blogging Website (and/or the involved Blogging Websites) may use the information obtained for marketing purposes.</p>
    
<br><h2> Cookies</h2><br>
<p>  The Blogging Website may automatically collect non-personally identifiable information and data through the use of "cookies." Cookies are small text files a Web site uses to recognize repeat users, facilitate the user's ongoing access to the site and facilitate the use of the site. "Cookies" also allow a site to track usage behavior and compile site usage information that will allow for the improvement of content and target advertising.</p>
    
<br><h2> Your Consent</h2><br>
<p>   By using our Web site, you consent to the collection and use of the information described in this Privacy Policy by the Blogging Website.</p>
    
<br><h2>  Questions?</h2><br>
<p> We welcome your questions and/or comments. Please send all queries to oladipupoazeez0@gmail.com.</p>
