    <h2>What is a Blog Website?</h2><br>

   <p> A blog website is one where users can put up their thoughts about anything and everything. You can make it as creative as you want to. There are thousands of blog websites out there. You can take inspiration from any of these blog websites and create your own blog. Here, people have to log in using their credentials and proper authentication will also be done. After that, the user can put up their blogs for the public. </p>
    
   <br><h2>Do I need to know how to code?</h2><br>

   <p>If you use a blogging platform like Wordpress or this blogging website (which I recommend to everyone), you don't need to code at all. You can choose and install a theme of your choice and use the interface to customize your blog and have it look the way you want. However, you may want to learn a little bit of CSS to make minor design changes that your theme may not offer. </p>

   <br><h2>How much does it cost to start a blog?</h2><br>
    
   <p>Using our guide, it would cost you a few bucks per month for your first year of blogging. This pays for one year of web hosting and your domain name. You shouldn't worry about this cost because you'll have many opportunities to make it all back.  </p>
 
   <br><h2>Which web host should I go with and why?</h2><br>

   <p>We recommend all new bloggers to start with HostGator. It's reliable, affordable, and the customer support will be there for you when you need it.</p>

   <br><h2>How do I choose a blog niche?</h2><br>

   <p>Find out what you are interested in and read more about blog niche online to find out what category it falls into and how you can combine your knowledge and your passion into a blog.</p> 

   <br><h2>Where do I go if I need help?</h2><br>

   <p>The great thing about being a blogger is that there's an endless source of people who are willing to help you. Bloggers love supporting each other. You can find and connect with each other on social media platforms like Facebook groups and Twitter.</p>

   <br><h2>How much time do I need to commit to blogging?</h2><br> 

   <p>This question is more difficult to answer because it is actually up to you and what your goals are. Ultimately, the more time you spend on writing articles and promoting your blog, the faster you'll start to see success. Successful bloggers spend anywhere between 20 minutes - a few hours a day on their blog when they first start blogging </p>

   <br><h2>What is the difference between a blog and a website?</h2><br>

   <p>A blog is simply a type of website. Blogs use blog software in order to make designing, writing, and publishing your content as simple and professional as possible. <br> Blogs can be customized to do just about anything, but most blogs tend to offer fresh content on a weekly basis along with the ability for readers to leave comments. These are not requirements however, as many large established sites (Bestbuy.com, Xerox.com, Time.com, etc.)use the WordPress blog software to create things that look nothing like traditional blogs. </p>

   <br><h2>Can I write about a variety of things on my blog or do I need to stick to just one?</h2><br>

   <p>Most bloggers write about a variety of subjects, so there is no need to stick to just one. However, you would probably need to organise your posts into categories so that visitors can easily find the post that they want to read.</p>

   <br><h2>What is web hosting?</h2><br>

   <p>Web hosting is a service that stores and delivers the files for your blog from a web server. When people visit your domain name the web hosting company delivers your blog files from their web server to the visitor. Every single website needs to have a web hosting in order to function, and a high-quality web host is very important if you want your blog function correctly.</p>

   <br><h2>What is the difference between BlueHost and WordPress?</h2><br>

   <p>BlueHost is a web hosting company, while WordPress is a blog software company. The WordPress software will be installed on your web server with BlueHost.</p>
